### Architecture & Design Patterns

My engineering approach is centered on building resilient and scalable systems, applying: 

- **Distributed Systems:** High-availability architectures (HA) and fault-tolerant designs.
- **Microservices Patterns:** Rigorous implementation of **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** and management of distributed transactions via the **SAGA Pattern** (Orchestration/Choreography).
- **Data Engineering:** Implementation of **Database Sharding** strategies and query optimization for high-throughput PostgreSQL workloads.
- **Asynchronous Messaging:** Decoupling services using fan-out patterns (SNS + SQS) and ensuring message durability and sequential processing with FIFO logic.
